## Environment

Our approach to maintaining a positive working environment is to discern each member's strengths that they can contribute towards the project. If more than one member shares the same strength for a particular task, we will split the work effort for that particular task.

<br>

## Processes

1.  *Mode of Communication* - Our main method of communication will be via MS Teams. We have also exchanged phone numbers and school e-mail addresses.

2.  *How to Schedule Meetings* - We have a channel in our MS Teams group dedicated to a schedule which we all agreed upon: **Mon, Wed, Fri - 8:00 PM EST**. Additionally, we have created reminders which send notifications to each member's Outlook account 1 hour prior to meetings.

3.  *How to Assign Tasks* - The division of labor is as follows:

    -   **Alec**: SLR analysis/chart; review hypothesis claims for `Carat`

    -   **David**: Narratives; review hypothesis claims for `Clarity`

    -   **Venkat**: Visualizations; review hypothesis claims for `Color`

    -   **Darreion**: Visualizations; review hypothesis claims for `Cut`

    Additionally, we have a channel in our MS Teams group dedicated to specific tasks, as well as a GitHub repository which we will store all of our files (code, markdown, etc.) so that each member has access to every part of the process.

4.  *How to Handle Disagreements*

    If for some reason there is a disagreement among team members, we have decided on a "majority-rule" schema â€“ meaning the popular approach will be the preferred method.

5.  *How to Handle Due Dates*

    We have decided that each member should establish their own due dates for their individual responsibilities. If for some reason the original due date cannot be met by the team member, a notification on MS Teams or via email will need to be sent to all members of the group **at least** 24 hours in advance.
